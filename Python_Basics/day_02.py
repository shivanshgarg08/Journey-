# Variables Practice exercise
# Clean Examples 
name = "Shivansh"
age = 21
city = "ghaziabadh"

print(name)
print(age)
print(city)

# Multiple Variable 
name = "sai"
age = 21
city = "noida"

print("Name:" ,   name)
print("Age:"  , age)
print("City:" , city)

# Variable Operations 
a = 10 
b = 5

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)


#Exercises 
my_name = "Shivansh Garg"
my_college = "ganga college"
my_age = 21

print("Name : ",my_name," ","College : ",my_college)

# Creating two numbers to perform variable operations 

c = 100
d = 50

print(c +d)
print(c-d)
print(c*d)
print(c/d)

#Swapping two variables 
e = 10
f = 5
a, b, c = a + 1, b + 2, c + 3
print(a,b,c)
